      <div class="card">
        <h3>Where does the data come from?</h3>
        <p>Our component databases combine datasheets, public data, and private measurements. All models are physics-guided and validated against experimental data.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>On-prem vs cloud?</h3>
        <p>Both deployment options are available. Private datasets remain your intellectual property, and we can work with your preferred infrastructure.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>What accuracy can I expect?</h3>
        <p>Our models are validated against hardware measurements. Efficiency predictions typically match experimental results within 1-2% for well-characterized topologies.</p>
