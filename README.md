# Spirit Connect – Power Labs

> **AI-Assisted Power Electronics Converter Design Automation**

Welcome to the public website repository of **Spirit Connect – Power Labs**.  
We accelerate power electronics development using artificial intelligence: from topology exploration to thermal analysis and control synthesis.

**Live site:** [https://fulongli.github.io/SCPowerLabs/](https://fulongli.github.io/SCPowerLabs/)

---

## What We Do

Spirit Connect – Power Labs builds **automation tools and workflows** that help engineers design high-performance power converters faster and with better trade-offs.

### Core Services

- **Microgrids** – Designing, modeling, and controlling DC and AC microgrids for resilient and efficient energy distribution
- **Converters** – Optimized converter design and control strategies for high-performance applications (buck/boost, LLC, DAB, multi-level DC-AC)
- **Devices** – Device testing, modeling, and characterization for power electronics design automation

### AI-Assisted Design Capabilities

- **AI-driven topology exploration** – LLC, DAB, multi-level, interleaved buck/boost, and more  
- **Magnetics and semiconductor selection** – WBG devices, core sizing, and winding optimization  
- **Loss & thermal modeling** – efficiency maps, safe operating areas, temperature predictions  
- **Control synthesis** – current/voltage loops, soft-switching zones, phase-shift and TPWM  
- **Multi-objective optimization** – efficiency vs. density vs. cost vs. EMI headroom  
- **Validation planning** – HIL/SIL hooks, automated test scripts, and repeatable experiments
